NAME
bcksystem.exclude - System defined exclusions for any backup.
DESCRIPTION
bcksystem.exclude contains one line for each file or directory to be skipped during any backup. This file should not be modified as it is always overwritten by application upgrades. User-desired exclusions should be placed in one of the other '.exclude' files as appropriate.
FILES
bcksystem.exclude	The file is stored in an etc directory. The exact location depends on the method of installation but for Autotools installations on Linux this is likely to be /usr/local/etc/backups/bcksystem.exclude.
