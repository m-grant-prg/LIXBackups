2013-08-22 v 1.0.23 Mark Grant <m.grant.prg@gmail.com>
	* Debian best practice documentation requires that programs placed in
	the PATH should not have extensions as the programs may be rewritten
	in a different language. This would then require a name change, or,
	if left as-is would cause confusion. So all names changed to remove .sh
	extension except for setup.sh which is not on the PATH.
